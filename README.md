## Whats with the versions?
Mayumi v1 is my first crack at making a discord bot. It used C# and while functional could only run on windows machines. I didn't have a suitable computer to run it 24/7 and quit after getting tired of boot up and install times.
I created Mayumi v2 and Aria as v1's python counterpart. I got too busy with irl stuff so I couldn't continue working on it.
Mayumi v3 still uses and is centered around supporting a chemistry server. Aria is used as a tester bot as to avoid disturbing servers.
Mayumi v4 uses javascript for easier installation and hosting.
