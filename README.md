# Mayumi-v2
## About
### What is Mayumi?
Mayumi is a general multipurpose Discord bot. Its currently under development by @Jerdan1980, @AnipWrites, and @Spikeshroom during their free time.
### Why v2?
Mayumi v2 is the second major iteration of Mayumi, with [Mayumi v1](https://www.github.com/Jerdan1980/Mayumi) being made in C# with [dsharplus](https://github.com/NaamloosDT/DSharpPlus). Mayumi v2 is mainly made in python using [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py). The reason for this was to allow Mayumi to be online 24/7 and is planned to be able to access more things and have a more intuitive way of interacting.
